1. Did you collaborate with anyone in the class? 
	NO.

2. Were there any references (books, papers, websites, etc.) that you found particularly helpful for completing your assignment? Please provide a list.
	[1] https://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/COURSES/cs3621/NOTES/spline/B-spline/bspline-derv.html
	[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trajectory.
	[3] https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/3d/rotationMatrices.html
	[4] https://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/ref/roty.html

Are there any known problems with your code? If so, please provide a list and, if possible, describe what you think the cause is and how you might fix them if you had more time or motivation. This is very important, as we're much more likely to assign partial credit if you help us understand what's going on.
	YES. I cannot generate swp files yet.

Did you do any extra credit? If so, let us know how to use the additional features. If there was a substantial amount of work involved, describe what and how you did it.
	NO.

Do you have any comments about this assignment that you'd like to share? We know this was a tough one, but did you learn a lot fram it? Or was it overhelming?
	Again, it still has wasted some time for me to try to build under Rosetta on M1 Macbook until I got one windows laptop.
